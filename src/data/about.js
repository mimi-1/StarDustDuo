      "Zhanna Zinchenko began her musical education at the Mayboroda College of Music in Zaporizhia, Ukraine and studied choir conducting at the Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Kyiv under the National Opera of Ukraine’s head choirmaster, professor Lev Venedyktov. Zhanna is a laureate in international choral and conducting competitions and has had a wide experience with a range of choirs as a choir member, vocalist and conductor. In 2001, she immigrated to Canada and soon after her arrival assumed duties as the deputy choir conductor at the St. Demetrius Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Toronto where she continues to work. In 2004, she was asked by maestro Roman Hurko to take over the leadership of the St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church choir in Toronto and has been the choir’s conductor and artistic director since.  In 2011, the Ukrainian Youth Ensembles Corporation hired Zhanna to conduct their women’s choir Levada and men’s choir Orion which she has led since then in performance at various concerts and community events. In January 2020, at the Velyka Koljada Festival in Lviv, Zhanna conducted the St. Nicholas Church choir in the world premieres of Roman Hurko’s arrangement of “Svjatsi sydily, kaminnja byly” (The Saints Sat, Breaking Stone), Adrian Ivakhiv’s arrangement of “Ponad bukovym lisom” (Above the Beech-tree Forest), a specially prepared quadri-lingual version of “The Huron Carol/Iesus Ahattonia,” and her own arrangement of “Oj pidemo, pane brate” (Oj, We Shall Go, My Brother). The performances garnered international praise.  Zhanna is also a piano teacher, vocal coach, and she is known for her work with children. She has recently begun a jazz collaboration with Victor Kowalenko in a duo Stardust.  As a young artist living in Zaporizhia Zhanna pursued her love of jazz in solo performances. While studying in Kyiv she performed with Beauty Band, a woman’s a cappella jazz group and in Canada she had the opportunity of debuting with the jazz band Orpheus. Her adaptable voice lends itself equally brilliantly to jazz as it does to sacred music.",
